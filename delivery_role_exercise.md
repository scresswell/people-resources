## Delivery Lead Role Scenario-based exercise
This task and interview are focused on understanding your technical capability for the Delivery Lead role.
We have a homework task for you to complete which is based on a hypothetical delivery scenario. As part of the task, we are asking you to prepare a presentation for a panel, which outlines how you would approach this scenario and deliver a positive outcome. 
Please note, there is no expectation for you to prepare large amounts of supporting material or presentation material. We’re more interested in understanding the rationale behind your ideas, and answers to any questions from the panel. 
### Scenario:
You will be joining our product and development team made up of several squads.
Our delivery vision is to see our teams achieving valuable outcomes for our customers and stakeholders, working together in an effective, efficient, and sustainable way.
One of our squads, which has been together for 6 months, is struggling and is becoming a concern. The squad has worked with a Delivery Delivery Manager before. That person is shared across multiple squads.
They’re experiencing some challenges with their way of working and poor communication between some team members is preventing collaborative teamwork. Quality is quickly becoming a concern due to inconsistent engineering practices. The team is working within a kanban framework and metrics, like ‘delivered vs committed’ and cycle time, indicate that delivery is sub optimal. The squad’s Product Manager has escalated that their longer-term roadmap is being impacted.
### Your task
As the Delivery Lead for this squad, we need you to develop a strategy for approaching this situation and delivering a positive outcome. To help us understand your approach, your presentation should include the following: 
- What are the first 5 questions you would like answered, and who would you ask?
- What does your first 30 days look like with the squad, and the wider team?
- What outcomes would you expect to have achieved in your first 3 months? What would we see, and how would you measure your success?
- Based on the scenario we’ve outlined, what practices do you think could be introduced to the squad and team? How would you approach introducing these?
In the interview, we’ll allow about 15 minutes for you to present your approach and then 15 minutes for discussion and questions.
